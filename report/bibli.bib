We introduce a new method for estimating the parameters of the Dirichlet Covariate Model when $\alpha$j(x) is a linear model on x, and also propose a Bayesian model selection approach. We present some numerical results which suggest that our proposals are more stable and robust than traditional approaches.},

In finite mixture models, the num- ber of clusters K should be given beforehand. Among the several approaches to model selection, Dirichlet Process Mixture Models, do not require specifying K while capable of adapting the number of clusters to changing data. In this report we will review the task of clustering and the problem of model selection and introduce DPMMs. As well we will give derivation for ex-act computation of a univariate Dirichletmixture model.},

@article{Pierotti2017,
abstract = {Indices of niche breadth and niche overlap for categorical data are typically expressed in terms of proportions of resources use. These are unit-sum constrained data; hence, direct application of standard general linear modelling methods to such indices can lead to spurious correlations and misleading inference. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compositional data analysis (CoDA) approach and derive compositional expressions of niche breadth, niche overlap and specialization. Compositional data analysis is specifically devoted to the analysis of vectors of proportions (i.e. compositions) and represents the appropriate framework for the study of sets of data with unit-sum constraint as those typically used in the calculation of niche indices. We show that compositional indices exhibit suitable statistical properties that make them flexible and robust, allowing downstream application of the full toolbox of multivariate analysis techniques to these estimators, a possibility not available with classical indices. In addition, we find that when characterizing niche breadth, niche overlap and specialization in terms of vectors of proportions, these concepts are naturally integrated in a coherent unifying framework. When data are categorical, we recommend the use of compositional indices for the statistical analysis of specialization metrics, niche breadth and niche overlap. We believe that the unified framework emerging from our compositional approach to niche metrics will allow a more thorough understanding of specialization at multiple levels of biological organization and provide novel insights in complex phenomena such as invasions and niche shifts.},

@incollection{VandenBoogaart2013,
abstract = {This book presents the statistical analysis of compositional data sets, i.e., data in percentages, proportions, concentrations, etc. The subject is covered from its grounding principles to the practical use in descriptive exploratory analysis, robust linear models and advanced multivariate statistical methods, including zeros and missing values, and paying special attention to data visualization and model display issues. Many illustrated examples and code chunks guide the reader into their modeling and interpretation. And, though the book primarily serves as a reference guide for the R package "compositions," it is also a general introductory text on Compositional Data Analysis. Awareness of their special characteristics spread in the Geosciences in the early sixties, but a strategy for properly dealing with them was not available until the works of Aitchison in the eighties. Since then, research has expanded our understanding of their theoretical principles and the potentials and limitations of their interpretation. This is the first comprehensive textbook addressing these issues, as well as their practical implications with regard to software. The book is intended for scientists interested in statistically analyzing their compositional data. The subject enjoys relatively broad awareness in the geosciences and environmental sciences, but the spectrum of recent applications also covers areas like medicine, official statistics, and economics. Readers should be familiar with basic univariate and multivariate statistics. Knowledge of R is recommended but not required, as the book is self-contained},

@article{Hijazi2009,
abstract = {Compositional data are non-negative proportions with unit-sum. These types of data arise whenever we classify objects into disjoint categories and record their resulting relative frequencies, or partition a whole measurement into percentage contributions from its various parts. Under the unit-sum constraint, the elementary concepts of covariance and correlation are misleading. Therefore, compositional data are rarely analyzed with the usual multivariate statistical methods. Aitchison [1] introduced the logratio analysis to model compositional data. Campbell and Mosimann [9] suggested the Dirichlet Covariate Model as a null model for such data. In this paper, the maximum likelihood estimation methods in Dirichlet regression are developed and the sampling distributions of these estimates are investigated. Measures of total variability and goodness of fit are proposed to assess the adequacy of the suggested models in analyzing compositional data.},

abstract = {A new parametric family of distributions on the unit simplex is proposed and investigated. Such family, called flexible Dirichlet, is obtained by normalizing a correlated basis formed by a mixture of independent gamma random variables. The Dirichlet distribution is included as an inner point. The flexible Dirichlet is shown to exhibit a rich dependence pattern, capable of discriminating among many of the independence concepts relevant for compositional data. At the same time it can model multi-modality. A number of stochastic representations are given, disclosing its remarkable tractability. In particular, it is closed under marginalization, conditioning, subcomposition, amalgamation and permutation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We then use the method of maximum likelihood to fit a nested Dirichlet joint prior distribution of x for all MLB batters (excluding pitchers) over the period from 2003-2006.},

@article{Kain2014,
abstract = {Researchers commonly use sports betting lines as predictions of the outcome of sporting events. Betting houses set betting lines conditional on bettors ex ante beliefs about game outcomes, which implies that the predictive power of the sports betting market could be an unintended consequence of betting house profit maximization. Using this insight, we propose a new test of the predictive power of the sports betting market, which incorporates a seldom-used piece of complementary betting information: the over/under—the predicted sum of scores for a game. Since the over/under has the same market properties as the betting line, it should be similarly predictive about the actual outcome, while if bettors have different beliefs about this game feature it need not be predictive. Using the universe of betting lines and over/unders on NFL, NBA, NCAA college football, and NCAA college basketball games from 2004-2010, we test the predictive power of the sports betting market in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) structure that allows us to characterize both features of the betting market simultaneously. Our joint test reveals that while the betting line is an accurate predictor of the margin of victory the over/under is a poor predictor of the sum of scores. We consistently reject the hypothesis that the sports betting market overall functions well as a prediction market.},
